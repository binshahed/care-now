    "more_detail": "A crown is like a jacket that encases a tooth and they can be made in a number of materials dependant on the strength required, and the look wanted. They are suggested when a tooth is broken or a large filling needs replacing. A crown can also be used to improve the appearance of a large discoloured filling. The crown preparation is sent to a laboratory where the skill of the technician is paramount in creating a tooth in one of three materials.The main choices of materials are: Porcelain bonded to precious metal: This is what most crowns are made from. A precious metal base is made and then porcelain is applied in layers over it. Porcelain crowns: These crowns are made entirely out of porcelain and are not as strong as bonded crowns, but they can look very natural and are most often used for front teeth. All-ceramic crowns: This modern technique offers a metal-free alternative, which can give the strength of a bonded crown and the appearance of a porcelain crown. Therefore it is suitable for use in all areas of the mouth. Glass: These crowns look very natural and are used on both front and back teeth."
